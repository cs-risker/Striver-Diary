In order to improve the system response speed as well as reduce the CPU burden, two refresh schemes for OLED were tested and compared respectively. The final choice is to use task notification management, which effectively reduces the refresh frequency and avoids unnecessary resource waste. It is planned to further use this scheme to manage the operation of sending and executing UHF RFID commands.
